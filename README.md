# UKSS-PI

**Unsupervised Keyword Scoring System with PageRank Integration**

---

## Description

**UKSS-PI** is an unsupervised keyword scoring system that uses both statistical methods and graphical (PageRank) approaches to rank keywords in a given text. Itâ€™s designed to identify and score relevant keywords without the need for pre-labeled data, combining traditional keyword extraction techniques with PageRank to boost precision and relevance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kasmik004/UKSS-PI.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory:

   ```bash
   cd UKSS-PI
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Replace the text inside `test.py` with the text you want to analyze.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 test.py
   ```

This will execute the analysis on your input text and output the extracted and scored keywords.
